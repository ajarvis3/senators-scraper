# senators-scraper

A Scraper to get senators from senate.gov...

Hosted on Heroku at still-brook-03232.herokuapp.com

Takes a few seconds to run... Sigh...

Runs from the built JAR file, don't know if there's a better way of doing it as of now

I guess that's that.

Heroku doesn't usually work. It seems to be an issue with fetching the page, all time is consumed with that.
The code itself seems fine.
